# üî• Firebase Security Rules Test Suite

Comprehensive automated testing for Firebase Security Rules using `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`.

## üìã Overview

This test suite provides complete coverage for both **Firestore** and **Storage** security rules, ensuring that all positive and negative scenarios are thoroughly tested. The tests run automatically in CI/CD pipelines and can be executed locally during development.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- Firebase CLI (`npm install -g firebase-tools`)
- Test dependencies (`npm install` in this directory)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm run test:firestore    # Firestore rules only
npm run test:storage      # Storage rules only

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Use the enhanced test runner
node run-all-tests.js                    # All tests
node run-all-tests.js --coverage         # With coverage
node run-all-tests.js firestore-rules.test.js  # Specific file
```

### Using Firebase Emulator

```bash
# Run tests with emulator (recommended)
npm run test:emulator

# For CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

- Unauthenticated access attempts
- Cross-user access attempts
- Invalid file types/sizes
- Permission escalation attempts
- Data tampering prevention

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Firebase Emulator Hosts (automatically set)
FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080
FIREBASE_STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9199
FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9099

# Test Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=fusion-fc-test
NODE_ENV=test
```

### Jest Configuration
```javascript
{
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  "testTimeout": 60000
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
The test suite is integrated with GitHub Actions and runs automatically on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests modifying rules files
- Changes to test files

### Workflow Features
- **Rules Validation:** Syntax validation of rules files
- **Comprehensive Testing:** All test scenarios with coverage
- **Performance Monitoring:** Benchmark execution times
- **Security Analysis:** Impact assessment for rules changes
- **Coverage Reports:** Automated coverage reporting

### Required Checks
PRs modifying security rules must pass:
- ‚úÖ All security rules tests
- ‚úÖ Rules syntax validation
- ‚úÖ Coverage requirements
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks

## üìä Coverage Requirements

The test suite maintains high coverage standards:
- **Functions:** >95% coverage
- **Branches:** >90% coverage  
- **Lines:** >95% coverage
- **Statements:** >95% coverage

## üîç Debugging Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test with verbose output
npx jest firestore-rules.test.js --verbose

# Debug with Node.js debugger
node --inspect-brk run-all-tests.js
```

### Common Issues
1. **Emulator Not Starting:** Check Firebase CLI installation
2. **Port Conflicts:** Ensure emulator ports are available
3. **Rules Syntax Errors:** Validate rules files before testing
4. **Timeout Issues:** Increase Jest timeout for slow operations

### Test Data
Test data is automatically exported/imported during emulator runs:
```
tests/test-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firestore_export/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage_export/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth_export/
```

## üìù Adding New Tests

### For New Rules
1. Add rule to `firestore.rules` or `storage.rules`
2. Create corresponding test cases in appropriate test file
3. Include both positive and negative scenarios
4. Test edge cases and security boundaries
5. Update this README with new coverage

### Test Template
```javascript
describe('New Feature Rules', () => {
  describe('Positive Cases', () => {
    test('authorized access works', async () => {
      await assertSucceeds(/* test operation */);
    });
  });

  describe('Negative Cases', () => {
    test('unauthorized access fails', async () => {
      await assertFails(/* test operation */);
    });
  });
});
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Write Tests First:** Add tests before modifying rules
2. **Test Coverage:** Ensure new code has >95% coverage
3. **Security Focus:** Always test negative scenarios
4. **Documentation:** Update README for new features
5. **CI Validation:** Ensure all CI checks pass

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Emulator Issues
```bash
# Kill existing emulator processes
pkill -f firebase
firebase emulators:kill

# Clear emulator data
rm -rf tests/test-data

# Restart emulators
firebase emulators:start
```

### Test Failures
```bash
# Run single test for debugging
npx jest --testNamePattern="specific test name"

# Clear Jest cache
npx jest --clearCache

# Verbose error output
DEBUG=* npm test
```
