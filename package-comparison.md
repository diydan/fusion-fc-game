# NPM Package Comparison: Old vs New Project

## Key Package Differences

### Three.js Related Packages

| Package | Old Project | New Project | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| three | 0.177.0 | 0.177.0 | ✅ Same version |
| @tresjs/core | 4.3.6 | 4.3.6 | ✅ Same version |
| @tresjs/cientos | 4.3.1 | 4.3.1 | ✅ Same version |
| three-stdlib | 2.36.0 | ❌ Missing | ⚠️ **CRITICAL: This is missing!** |
| @tresjs/post-processing | 2.4.0 | ❌ Missing | May affect visual quality |

### Other Notable Differences

| Package | Old Project | New Project | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------|
| pinia | 3.0.1 | 2.2.6 | Old has newer version |
| vue-router | 4.5.0 | 4.4.5 | Minor version difference |
| vuetify | 3.8.12 | 3.7.5 | Old has newer version |

## Critical Finding

**The `three-stdlib` package is missing from the new project!** This package provides the FBXLoader and other essential Three.js utilities. This is likely why the character body is not loading properly.

## Recommendation

Install the missing package in the new project:
```bash
npm install three-stdlib@^2.36.0
```

Additionally, consider installing:
```bash
npm install @tresjs/post-processing@^2.4.0
```
